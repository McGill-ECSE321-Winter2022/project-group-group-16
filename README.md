# ECSE 321 - Introduction to Software Engineering

Grocery Store Application

The goal of this project is to develop an online software application that supports the needs of a local grocery store and its customers. Customers are able to create online accounts that lets them browse, purchase and order available items on the grocery store. The system also lets the owner manage general aspects of the employees, such as their status (active, banned, quit), their hourly pay, as well as their shifts and the date that they were hired. 

Team Members : Michelle Lee, Arturo Mory Ramirez, Yoah Qiu, Danny Tu, Jian Long Ye (Noah), Yazdan Seyed Zinati <br/>
